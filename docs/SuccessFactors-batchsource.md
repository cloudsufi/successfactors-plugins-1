**Select Fields (M, O)**: Fields to be preserved in the extracted data. e.g.: Category, Price, Name, Address. In case of empty all the non-navigation fields will be preserved in the extracted data.
All the fields must be comma (,) separated.  
**Expand Fields (M, O)**: List of navigation fields to be expanded in the extracted output data
e.g.: customManager  
**Number of Rows to Skip (M, O)**: Number of rows to skip e.g.: 10.  
**Number of Rows to Fetch (M, O)**: Total number of rows to be extracted (accounts for conditions specified
in Filter Options).     
**Number of Splits to Generate (M, O)**: The number of splits is used to partition the input data. If not specified at UI, by default it is 8 splits. Otherwise, the user-provided splits at UI prevail over
defaulted splits.    
**Batch Size (M, O)**: Number of rows to fetch in each network call to SAP SuccessFactors. Smaller size will cause frequent
network calls repeating the associated overhead. A large size may slow down data retrieval & cause
excessive resource usage in SAP SuccessFactors. If this value is set to 0, default value is set to 2500 and max limit on
rows to fetch in each batch is 5000.
