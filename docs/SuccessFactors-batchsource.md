**Select Fields (M, O)**: Fields to be preserved in the extracted data. e.g.: Category, Price, Name, Address. In case of empty all the non-navigation fields will be preserved in the extracted data.
All the fields must be comma (,) separated.

**Expand Fields (M, O)**: List of navigation fields to be expanded in the extracted output data
e.g.: customManager

**Associated Entity Name (M, O)**: Name of the Associated Entity which is being extracted
e.g.: EmpCompensationCalculated

**Pagination Type (M, O)** : The type of pagination to be used. Server side pagination is chosen by default. 
Server Side Pagination uses Snapshot based pagination. If snapshot-based pagination is attempted on an entity that 
doesnâ€™t support the feature, the server automatically forces client offset pagination on the query.
